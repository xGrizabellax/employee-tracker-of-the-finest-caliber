  ## Installation:
  Open the application in two terminals and have mysql running in one, and the root of the application running in the other. Use the data in the 'schema.sql' and run them in the SQL terminal to creat your database and tables, then you may run the app by typing 'npm start' in the command line of your other terminal. From there you will be prompted to add, view, and edit any information of your liking.

Having two terminals running side by side is the most efficient way to start application correctly:
